# Learning Agda - Practice Files

This directory contains tutorial exercises and learning materials.

Feel free to experiment here without worrying about breaking the formal proofs.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. **PLFA Part 1** (Logical Foundations)
   - Naturals.agda - Natural numbers, recursion
   - Induction.agda - Proof by induction
   - Relations.agda - Binary relations, ordering

2. **PLFA Part 2** (Programming Languages)
   - Lambda.agda - Untyped lambda calculus
   - Properties.agda - Progress and preservation
   - DeBruijn.agda - DeBruijn indices (for our environment)

3. **Mini Projects**
   - SimpleArith.agda - Arithmetic expressions with small-step semantics
   - SimpleTypes.agda - Simply-typed lambda calculus

Once comfortable, move to `../agda/` for Sub_Async formalization.
