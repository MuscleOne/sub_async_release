# 01_basic.sub - Basic async demonstration
#
# Demonstrates:
# 1. `async` creates futures and returns immediately
# 2. Using future value registers continuation
# 3. When task completes, `complete` calls all waiting continuations
#
# Expected output:
#   [async] Created future #0, #1, #2
#   [✓] Future #N completed
#   [complete] calling continuations
#   Result: 161  (5 + 100 + 56)

let x = async (2 + 3) in
let y = async (10 * 10) in  
let z = async (7 * 8) in
